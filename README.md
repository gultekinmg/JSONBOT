That Chess Engine Alernative is unTracible by any moderator because of it is based on scripts only and All games played beforehand.
It is FASTEST CHESS ENGINE ever build as Tested finishing all games at less then "ONE SECOND", if it playes against itself.
It playes all chess variants PGN BASEs available. Therefore it plays best when you have a HUGE PGN BASE DATA.
So when no move available you need to extend your database.
Algorithm lays on query and filter moves Shortest WIN for selected side on JSON Database.
