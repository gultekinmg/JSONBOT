# JSONBOT
Fasted PGN Based Untracible Chess Engine Alternative
--------------------------------------------------
That Chess Engine Alernative is unTracible by any moderator because of it is based on scripts only and All games played beforehand.
# It is FASTEST CHESS ENGINE ever build as Tested finishing all games at less then "ONE SECOND", if it playes against itself.
--------------------------
# It playes all chess variants PGN BASEs available. Therefore it plays best when you have a HUGE PGN-BASE DATA.
--------------------------
So when no move available you need to extend your database.
Algorithm lays on query and filter moves Shortest WIN for selected side on JSON Database.

You can setup variables as play most like HUMAN or GM or Stockfish orSurprize Winner or Brutal quick Winner or longer Delayer ext.

# I have not publish yet master code here for end of date may kill internetchess my patient is over on Chess Cheaters with Lag Switches and Engines. 
it has been tested at fics 3 years ago. now it works on Chess.bom Liechess etc.
Most horrible so easy to adapt ANDROID devies.
--------------------------
# Branch CONVERTOR; - you can test that.
an evaluation convertor Multi PGN file to Array formatted JSON file.
That HTML based convertor takes a little time to reformat Billion based PGN files to JSON Database.
you need to ignore Browser stalls to reach aim mostly 10 minutes a GB file.
To reduce source outcome there exist also another short coding by chessforeva for further TODOs.
